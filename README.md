How to quickly change interface gimp like photoshop

To help a fellow deviant, I've put together a download that anyone with Gimp 2.8 on Linux can use to make their copy of Gimp look more like Adobe Photoshop and make people more comfortable.

I've taken various bits of guides online and various tweaks.
All you have to do is download the file, unzip it.
Then in the file manager go to your home folder, show hidden files, delete or move your old .gimp-2.8 configuration folder out of the way, and replace with the new one.
Then load Gimp.

Please let me know if it works for you or if it fails.
